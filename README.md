### What I learned

I had alot of fun completing this challenge and learned so much!

### Continued development

I've been doing projects from front end mentor to practice what I've learned from the scrimba web dev career path boot camp.
I plan on taking a break form front end mentor and goin back to my classes. The next class in my boot camp is on working with APIs 
so once I finish that module I will attempt one of the front end mentor challenges that involves using and API.
